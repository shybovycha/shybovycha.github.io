# Functional web

In last couple of years the functional programming paradigm became very popular.
A huge amount of libraries, tools, tutorials and blog posts appeared.
Although the paradigm itself is rather old _(lambda calculus was developed around 1930 and the Lisp language was introduced in 1950)_, its popularity blowed up rapidly somewhere in 2014-2016 and that's what is happening right now.
Probably one of the most powerfull influencers, giving FP _(functional programming)_ that thrust is web development.
Since Facebook introduced **React**, the community started incorporating many things from FP with React - including **Redux** and **Immutable.js**.
But there are much more interesting things which were invented on this wave of FP popularity. One of them is (Elm)[http://elm-lang.org/]
