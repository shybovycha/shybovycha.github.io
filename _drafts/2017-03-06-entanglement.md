# Entanglement?

Some time ago there was a game popular over there, called Entanglement:

There are a few implementations of this game under Android:

<img data-src="{{ '/images/entanglement/screenshot4.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="">

But there was no such game for iOS. And as I pursued my second M. Sc. degree, I have had a course
"iOS development", where we were learning to use Swift and iOS platform.

As a course project I decided to implement this game. In Swift. Originally the game was implemented
in Swift 2 _(there was no Swift 3 back those days)_.

And recently I decided to refactor the game a bit and update it to the most recent Swift version
_(which is Swift 3 by the moment of writing this post)_.
