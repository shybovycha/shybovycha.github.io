so relied on math I've barely could imagine myself doing such research back when I was in school!..

Photography became one of my hobbies and I'm now found of macro photography. Especially with super-macro photography,
when you make insanely close-up shots of tiny insects.

The problem with super-macro is the very narrow focus plane.
