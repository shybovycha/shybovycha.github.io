Insider Monkey has crafted a list ranking 25 inventions made in 21st century that have significant impact on the world.

The scoring system of 60 points max leads to a questionable rating list, but first, here's the list (source: [25..11](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-most-important-inventions-21st-204141013.html), [10..1](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/10-most-important-inventions-of-the-21st-century-1197687/)):

25. 3D printing (score 34)
24. Birth control patch (score 35)
23. Humanoid robots (score 37)
22. Capsule endoscopy (score 38)
21. Blockchain Technology (score 39)
20. Subscription video on-demand dervices (score 40)
19. Smart home services (score 41)
18. Artificial organs (score 42)
17. Smart energy grids (score 43)
16. Quantum computing (score 45)
15. 5G technology (score 46)
14. Hydrogen fuel cells (score 47)
13. Drones (score 48)
12. Autonomous vehicles (score 49)
11. Human genome mapping (score 50)
10. Reusable rockets (score 51)
9. GPS navigation (score 52)
8. Cloud computing (score 53)
7. Biometric technology (score 54)
6. Electric vehicles (score 55)
5. Internet of things (score 56)
4. Augmented and virtual reality (score 57)
3. Social media (score 58)
2. Smartphones (score 59)
1. Transformer LLM architecture (score 60)

In my humble (and quite cynic) opinion, this is a very profit-driven rating, putting things that are more beneficial from the revenue perspective, rather than actually helpful for humanity or the planet.
I don't believe IoT, social media and LLMs make the lives of majority of humans better by any stretch, neither do they make a good impact on the environment (only worse, if anything, by consuming massive amounts of electricity on something that is definitely not important for humanity).
Compared to artificial organs and hydrogen energy cells or even capsule endoscopy, there is a handful of actually usefull inventions on the list. Whereas the majority of it (including social media, LLMs, blockchain, cloud computing, IoT and smart home, on-demand video and AR/VR) is only damaging to the environment and useful for the corporate world.
