title: One-night games
---

I've always wanted to write a few relatively simple games just to practice my coding skills.
Back when I was at the uni, I've made [peg solitaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peg_solitaire) and [three-in-a-row](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bejeweled) games in C/C++ with SFML. I even have written a _(pretty shitty)_ server-client [chess game](https://github.com/shybovycha/moo-chess) _(be warned: this code was written in 2011 and only contains fixes to make it run on a new version of SFML, so it might look... smelly... on each and every line...)_.
