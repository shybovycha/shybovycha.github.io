## Why i like "The Legends Of Andor"

* awesome story
* smooth learning curve - all the steps are gently described in every legend, step-by-step, including the things you need to prepare for the legend
* many story options - it's not just hack-n-slash, but finding a witch, bringing a herb to the castle, etc.

## What i don't quite like about the game

* the story has no actual background and was put little bit aside the gameplay
* the Narrator & time mechanic - sometimes it is not balanced well, so you end up having to kill lots of monsters to defeat the castle **and** need to go to the other part of the world to fight a tough monster, but you can't do both because each monster killed will bring game closer to its end and if you don't get all your heroes strong enough to fight the "boss" together - you will loose the game because of incomplete legend' task
* the AI - it is lame. monsters just appear in batches, but they never engage players on their own, they are just moving to the castle with no clear reason why the hell do they need that castle
* ranged combat - it is useless - yes, it can save you one hour of movement, but that kind of does not make sense, since enemy will respond anyways, so range combat does not give any advantage
* characters' special abilities - they are mostly all about rolling the dice. so mage does not differ from archer or warrior that much - except of having just one dice (which is goddamn weak)

## What i'd love to change

* it would be nice to see something like, for example, archer having more movement hours
* range combat should be one-way for characters with bows - meelee creatures should not respond to a ranged attack; alternatively, it would be nice to see the range or strength modifiers for the ranged attacks - crossbows maybe? long bows? rifles for dwarves?
* there should definitely be a script for monsters so that they appear smarter, not just much stronger than the heroes
