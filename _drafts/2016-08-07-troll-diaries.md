## 7 Aug

I'm still working on my M.Sc. thesis. 
In less than 5 days we are leaving for our first troll hunt. 
Never thought that country is THAT DAMN EXPENSIVE!

## 9 Aug

We're screwed up: we have no credit card, so we can not afford
a car rental. The weather forecast is +8..+14C degrees at daytime
and nearly 0C at night. Plus, hard raining. 

Spent lot of time looking for new lenses for my Pentax camera
and ended up with the decision to buy not-that-cheap, but awesome zooming
converter, Raynox MSN-505 for ultimate macro shots. $150, though...

## 10 Aug

Weather in Krak√≥w is same: +14C and raining all day long. Just
tried my new waterproof poncho and it is great! Weather forecast for
Odda, Norway is somewhat better for Sunday: +15C and cloudy. Maybe
hiking would not be the bad idea?..

My co-worker, Christian, who is from Swizerland, commented our trip:
_"Enjoy (cold) autumn weather!"_.
