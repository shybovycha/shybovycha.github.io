title: "My understanding of quantum physics"
---

Quantum physics is a complex and (by the time of this post) not quite well understood topic.

Here is my understanding of quantum phenomena after reading up some materials on the internet.

### Elementary particles

Since childhood, I knew matter is made of molecules, which are made of atoms.
In school I learned atoms have core and elementary particles orbiting them.
Now we know atom nucleus (core) is made of even smaller things - protons and neutrons and electrons still orbiting the nucleus.

### Photon is both wave and a particle

Light behaves as both wave and a beam of particles.

Related experiment: double-slit experiment, where a beam of light creates a predictable (computable) interference pattern
instead of two separate strips on the screen after passing through two narrow slits.

Related experiment: photoelectric effect, where a beam of light projected onto a piece of metal (sodium), connected to
a two strips of foil on a hinge, isolated from the outer world (in a jar), makes the foils repulse from one another in the same way
as if a charged plastic tube physically touching the piece of the same metal.

### Spin

Aside from charge, mass and velocity, elementary particles have a spin.

Related experiment: Stern-Gerlach experiment, where a beam of electrons passing through a magnet field split into exactly two groups.
Always into two groups, even if the magnet was turned sideways (90 deg).

My understanding: a spin is a general direction of the particle's own magnetic field, which defines which magnetic pole
the particle would be more attracted towards in the Stern-Gerlach experiment.

### Entanglement

Two particles are said to be entangled if their quantum state is same. And by changing the quantum state of one entangled particle,
the quantum state of the other entangled particle will change in the same manner, regardless of how far apart these particles are.

My understanding: the entanglement is merely the fact of sharing same properties (same spin, same charge, etc.) between particles.
It changes irreversibly once a particle interacts with anything (air molecule, measurement device, QOB crystal, etc.).
The "regardless of how far apart" part is missing the part where "no interactions are done to another particle".

### Superposition

Elementary particle is said to be in a state of superposition, which is a sum of all stimuli applied to the particle.
Commonly known as "particle is simultaneously in all of its possible states".

Related experiment: Schrodinger's cat thought experiment.

My understanding: particle is not really in all states simultaneously, but rather we do not know the state of the particle
until we measure it, since we do not have the tools to provide a single particle with all known (discretely defined) properties.
Thus we can at best describe potential properties' values a particle can have. We will only know the exact values once we "open the box"
or measure the particle. Moreover, since we can not measure one specific particle, we can only measure the one we managed to get
from a potentially infinite stream of particles.

### Wave function collapse

Elementary particles are described as sets of wave equations (one per each attribute - spin, velocity, position).
The said equations describe probability distribution of a particle property having a specific value.
The phenomenon of a wave function collapse, where a given property "obtains" a specific value does not have a formal
definition in quantum mechanics, so there are few interpretation proposals (many-worlds interpretation, consistent histories, quantum decoherence, etc.).

Related experiment: Schrodinger's cat thought experiment.

My understanding: since we do not have means of knowing the initial state of a specific single particle, let alone enforcing it
(making it have discrete values), we can only describe a probability of _any_ particle (in a given environment),
having one of described values. Once we measure a given particle' property, we observe the specific values after particle underwent
a series of interactions with the world after being produced to the measurement system.
It is akin to trying to predict the state of the stone thrown by someone - there is no knowing of initial velocity or the shape
or the direction of the stone. We can have some predictions (even quite accurate), but we can only get the exact properties of the stone
either when we measure it in the flight or if we know the exact properties of the stone beforehand and the person throwing it can provide
us with the exact values of the throw (exact direction and velocity).

### Quantum uncertainty

This is a limit to what we can know about a particle - it could be either a position or momentum, but not both. In other words, the more accurately one property is measured, the less accurately the other property can be known.

My understanding: this is a problem of our measurement tools.

### Bell's theorem, Vienn diagram paradox and "spooky action at a distance"

As Einstein described the phenomena "spooky action at a distance".
This is the measured vs predicted value paradox, introduced by the three overlapping (at 90 deg and 45 def) polarizing filters,
where measured amount of light passing through the segment of all 3 overlapping filters is greater than the light passing through
the segment of only two overlapping filters.

If shown on a vienn diagram, the amount of light should be 50% when passing through one filter, the other 50% when passing through another
filter at 90 deg to the first one and 25% when passing third filter, at 45 deg to either of the first two. In fact, it is 15%.

Related experiment: three overlapping polarizing filters.

### Quantum computers and qubits

Qubits are the building blocks of quantum computer - instead of CPU and bits / bytes, quantum computer relies on the quantum physics phenomena,
such as superposition and entanglement. Qubits are the means of producing entangled particles. Quantum computer then has to have the devices
to manipulate the state of the said entangled particles.
