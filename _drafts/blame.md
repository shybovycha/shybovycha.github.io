so, the plot goes like this: Cibo acquired a capsule with genetic sample, potentially containing the Net Terminal Gene. After she was captured by Dhomochevsky, she lost the capsule to the Silicone Creatures, who also aimed to access the Net Sphere. Ultimately, Silicone Creature named Davine Lu Linvega tried gaining the temporary access to the Net Sphere and managed to get it for a very short time, despite the attempts of Authority to prevent them from. They managed to steal the data of a Safeguard of the highest level. At around the same time, Cibo managed to double-register in the Net Sphere and transfer the genetic data from the aforementioned capsule into herself. It is not entirely clear how and why, but she then is transformed into the Level 9 Safeguard unit. After she is complete, she is seen carrying the sphere, effectively being "pregnant" with the creature possessing the Net Terminal Gene.
