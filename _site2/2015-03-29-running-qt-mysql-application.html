<p>Yesterday I tried to run my university project made with Qt and MySQL. But all I got was strange error message, saying <code>QMYSQL driver is not loaded</code> whilst loaded driver list actually included that one.</p>

<p>Searching all over the internet up &#39;til 2 AM and recompiling the whole Qt gave no result except time being wasted. Yeah, and 90% of search results were tutorials on how to recompile Qt MySQL plugin under Windows.</p>

<p>Yet in the morning I found solution and it was beautifully simple! I just performed one step from <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/deployment.html">Deploying Qt applications</a>, actually just copied the <code>plugins/</code> directory to the dir where the application executable lives (<code>build-debug/</code> or <code>build-release/</code> for my project; I hate the default <code>build-#{ProjectName}-Desktop_5_4_1-Debug/</code> paths); included the <code>sqldrivers/</code> directory there (just copied) and created (a bit tuned although) the <code>qt.conf</code> file. That file just pointed the plugins path to the custom one:</p>
[Paths]
Prefix=.
Plugins=./plugins

<p>To sum everything up:</p>

<ol>
<li>create a <code>plugins/</code> directory in your build directory</li>
<li>copy <code>Qt/5.4/Src/qtbase/plugins/platforms/</code> there</li>
<li>copy <code>Qt/5.4/gcc_64/plugins/sqldrivers/</code> there too</li>
<li>create <code>qt.conf</code> file in build directory and fill it as mentioned above</li>
</ol>

<p>And one more hint before the end: to debug why your Qt plugins fail use this application startup switch: <code>QT<u>DEBUG</u>PLUGINS=1 ./app_name</code> - this will display plugins debug information.</p>
