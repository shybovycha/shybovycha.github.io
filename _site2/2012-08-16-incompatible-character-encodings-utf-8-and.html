<p>Just got the following error in my Rails project (Rails 3.2.6, Ruby 1.9.3):</p>
ActionView::Template::Error (incompatible character encodings: UTF-8 and ASCII-8BIT)

<p>That was caused by the case when MySQL record (ActiveReciord object, actually) contained UTF-8 characters and i was trying to output those chars in my template.
But <strong>mysql</strong> gem does not support those. It needs a bit of hacking.</p>

<p>Luckily, there is more convenient way to solve the problem. The solution of this issue now appears too easy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Install the <code>mysql2</code> gem</li>
<li>Use <code>adapter: mysql2</code> instead of <code>adapter: mysql</code> in your <code>config/database.yml</code> file</li>
</ul>
