<p>As there was not a high load on my tutorial on game development with Irrlicht and Newton Game Dynamics engines
as a separate site, I have decided to merge them with my blog and proceed with occasional updates to both as a
whole.</p>

<p>So far, these are the changes to the tutorial in comparison to what it used to be <u>(long time ago)</u>:</p>

<ul>
<li>moved all the build instructions to <strong>CMake</strong></li>
<li>added scripting with <strong>Lua</strong></li>
<li>upgraded the whole tutorial to match <strong>latest Irrlicht and Newton versions</strong></li>
<li>added chapter on <strong>modelling with Blender</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The things which are already done (just not published yet), in progress and the future plans for this tutorial include:</p>

<ul>
<li>comparison of different build systems for C++ (including <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a>, <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> and <a href="https://buckbuild.com/">Buck</a>)</li>
<li>a better approach to application architecture (plus the comparison of different scripting languages - <a href="https://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/">AngelScript</a>, <a href="http://www.squirrel-lang.org/">Squirrel</a>, <a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>, <a href="http://chaiscript.com/">ChaiScript</a> and <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a>)</li>
<li>a sane 3D modelling in blender lessons (preserving texturing and adding advanced materials, possibly even animation!)</li>
<li>advanced topics in Newton Game Dynamics featuring character controller and joints</li>
</ul>

<p>Tutorial chapters <em>(yet to be updated)</em>:</p>
