Insider Monkey has crafted a list ranking 25 inventions made in 21st century that have significant impact on the world.

The scoring system of 60 points max leads to a questionable rating list, but first, here's the list (source: [25..11](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-most-important-inventions-21st-204141013.html), [10..1](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/10-most-important-inventions-of-the-21st-century-1197687/)):

25. 3D printing (score 34)
24. Birth control patch (score 35)
23. Humanoid robots (score 37)
22. Capsule endoscopy (score 38)
21. Blockchain Technology (score 39)
20. Subscription video on-demand dervices (score 40)
19. Smart home services (score 41)
18. Artificial organs (score 42)
17. Smart energy grids (score 43)
16. Quantum computing (score 45)
15. 5G technology (score 46)
14. Hydrogen fuel cells (score 47)
13. Drones (score 48)
12. Autonomous vehicles (score 49)
11. Human genome mapping (score 50)
10. Reusable rockets (score 51)
9. GPS navigation (score 52)
8. Cloud computing (score 53)
7. Biometric technology (score 54)
6. Electric vehicles (score 55)
5. Internet of things (score 56)
4. Augmented and virtual reality (score 57)
3. Social media (score 58)
2. Smartphones (score 59)
1. Transformer LLM architecture (score 60)

In my humble (and quite cynic) opinion, this is a very profit-driven rating, putting things that are more beneficial from the revenue perspective, rather than actually helpful for humanity or the planet.
I don't believe IoT, social media and LLMs make the lives of the majority of people better by any stretch, neither do they make a good impact on the environment (only worse, if anything, by consuming massive amounts of electricity on something that is definitely not helpful or important for humanity).
Compared to artificial organs and hydrogen energy cells or even capsule endoscopy, there is a handful of actually usefull inventions on the list. Whereas the majority of it (including social media, LLMs, blockchain, cloud computing, IoT and smart home, on-demand video and AR/VR) is only damaging to the environment and useful for the corporate world.

In my mind the list should be first reduced to only list actually important inventions:

25. 3D printing
24. ~~Birth control patch~~ (not a breaktrhough, just another option)
23. ~~Humanoid robots~~ (no real value, just different form factor)
22. Capsule endoscopy
21. ~~Blockchain Technology~~ (useless for all cases and scenarios)
20. ~~Subscription video on-demand dervices~~ (money grab, useless for anyone except investors)
19. ~~Smart home services~~ (useless for most, mostly money grab)
18. Artificial organs
17. ~~Smart energy grids~~ (only useful for energy companies)
16. Quantum computing
15. 5G technology
14. Hydrogen fuel cells
13. Drones
12. Autonomous vehicles
11. Human genome mapping
10. Reusable rockets
9. GPS navigation
8. ~~Cloud computing~~ (only useful for investors and big players)
7. Biometric technology
6. Electric vehicles
5. ~~Internet of things~~
4. ~~Augmented and virtual reality~~
3. ~~Social media~~
2. Smartphones
1. ~~Transformer LLM architecture~~

And in my humble opinion the ranking should also shift quite a bit, but that would depend on a plethora of criteria, so for instance the tech for convenience (5G, GPS, autonomus vehicles and birth control patches) vs breakthrough (capsule endoscopy, quantum computing, hydrogen fuel cells) or how refined the technology is (GSP vs quantum computing) or how many people does it affect (smartphones vs reusable rockets).
