Back in 2021 I wrote a [series of blog posts](/strongly-typed-front-end/2021/04/19/introduction.html) about using various functional languages on front-end.
It is 2024 and things have changed slightly, so I wanted to give it another look and another perspective.
Back then I was mostly focused on the developer experience with each language. Now I would like to factor in the *transition* experience
(e.g. how hard is it to start using this tech in a real project) and the *correctness* of the code produced
(meaning how resilient the code becomes or how easy it is to introduce bugs and find and fix them later on).
