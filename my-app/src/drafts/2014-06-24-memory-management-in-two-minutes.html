<p>Each data object (or data structure if you want) should have <strong>modificators</strong>, <strong>selectors</strong>, <strong>constructor</strong> and <strong>destructor</strong>.</p>

<p>This is known as <strong>memory management</strong> in C. And this statement is valid for any kind of data.</p>

<p>Thus, if you&rsquo;ve allocated memory - you <strong>MUST</strong> clean it up. Created an object - destroy it when it&rsquo;s no longer in need. Filled the database - clean it up lately, when the information stored is useless.</p>
