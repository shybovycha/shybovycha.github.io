## 7 Aug

I'm still working on my M.Sc. thesis.
In less than 5 days we are leaving for our first troll hunt.
Never thought that country is THAT DAMN EXPENSIVE!

## 9 Aug

We're screwed up: we have no credit card, so we can not afford
a car rental. Weather forecast is +8..+14C degrees in the day
and around 0C at night. Moreover, heavy rain.

Spent lot of time looking for a new lens for my Pentax camera
and ended up buying not-that-cheap converter with awesome magnification,
Raynox MSN-505 for ultimate macro shots. 150 USD though...

## 10 Aug

Weather in Krak√≥w is same: +14C and raining all day long. Just
tried my new waterproof poncho and it is great! Weather forecast for
Odda, Norway is somewhat better for Sunday: +15C and cloudy. Maybe
hiking is not that bad idea, after all?..

My co-worker, Christian, originally from Swizerland, commented on our trip:
_"Enjoy (cold) autumn weather!"_.
