<p>Like music? We fucking love music. Which is why we’re so excited to finally announce that we’ve hooked up with <a href="http://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a> to bring their network of sound (music, podcasts, standup, journalism, and pretty much anything audible) to Tumblr.</p>
<p>Not only can you cut-and-paste any SoundCloud track URL into your Audio posts, now you can search SoundCloud from the comfort of Tumblr!</p>

<p>And did we mention you can post an <strong>unlimited</strong> number of SoundCloud tracks every day? Yeah.</p>
<p>But where this really shines is on your beautiful blogs. We pull in the track info, album art, and play count, to display perfectly in your theme. Here’s one in our <em><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/theme/8943">Well Liked</a></em> theme:</p>

<p>And just when we thought it couldn’t get any better, our wonderful friends at SoundCloud just added a “<em>Share on Tumblr</em>” feature to their <a href="http://soundcloud.com/apps/iphone">iPhone</a>/<a href="http://soundcloud.com/apps/android">Android</a> apps, Tumblr buttons on all SoundCloud tracks, and Tumblr <a href="http://soundcloud.com/settings/advanced">auto-posting</a> for SoundCloud users. *swoon*</p>
