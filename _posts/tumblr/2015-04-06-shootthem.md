A few days ago I’ve found my old game, _ShootThem!_ sources. 

Half of hour being trying to run it, and viola!

Placed all the sources with its dependencies on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/shybovycha/shoot-them">https://github.com/shybovycha/shoot-them</a>

One has no story (in-game, but has one written before the game presentation on a programming competition for students in Dnepropetrovsk). It has _(almost)_ no colors. No code structure or architecture. No animations. 

It is really plain.

Yet, it was and remains a starting point for me =)

Here are some of game screenshots:
