<p>Just got the following error in my Rails project (Rails 3.2.6, Ruby 1.9.3):</p>

<p><em>ActionView::Template::Error (incompatible character encodings: UTF-8 and ASCII-8BIT)</em></p>

<p>That was caused by the case when MySQL record (ActiveReciord object, actually) contained UTF-8 characters and i was trying to output those chars in my template. But <strong>mysql</strong> gem does not support those. It needs some hacking.</p>

<p>Luckily, there is more convenient way to solve the problem. The solution of this issue now appears too easy:</p>

<ul><li>Install the <strong>mysql2</strong> gem</li>
<li>Use <strong>adapter: mysql2</strong> instead of <em>adapter: mysql</em> in your <strong>config/database.yml</strong> file</li>
</ul>
