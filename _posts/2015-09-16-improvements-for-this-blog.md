You may noticed many improvements have been made to my blog recently. One of them is the "new post countdown". It may seem childyish, but its aim is much more different from marketing or design anti-pattern.

See, writing a post requires some effort. Thus, to prevent myself from fooling around I needed a strictly set deadline for a job to be done. And this timer is a deadline countdown for me.

Let's see, how it goes from now!
