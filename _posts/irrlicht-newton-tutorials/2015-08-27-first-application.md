## Install Irrlicht

First of all, you will definetely need the Irrlicht engine, so
[**go get it**](http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/downloads/).

Then you will need to compile it. Compilation process depends on the operating system you use,
but it's really similar on every one.

### Linux

Install these dependencies with your system' package manager:
`libenet-dev libxxf86vm-dev zlib-dev cmake`.

Unzip Irrlicht, go to the directory you unpacked with the terminal and run the following:

```bash
cd source/Irrlicht
make
```

Belive it or not, but that's all!

### Windows

Unzip Irrlicht, go to the directory you unpacked and open the VisualStudio project _(depending on
VisualStudio version, you might want to open a bit different file)_ in `source/Irrlicht`:

```txt
Irrlicht10.0.sln
Irrlicht11.0.sln
Irrlicht8.0.sln
Irrlicht9.0.sln
```

Build it with VisualStudio - and you are done!

### MacOS X

The steps are a bit complicated. And they require you to install **XCode** and
**Command-Line Tools** - those could be found either in  AppStore or on the Apple
website.

* First of all, you need to install a bunch of dependencies _(I use `brew` for this purpose)_:

    ```bash
    brew install tinyxml enet lua cmake
    ```

* Get a list of all compilers available for your OSX version:

  ```bash
  xcodebuild -showBuildSettings | grep DEFAULT_COMPILER
  ```

  I got something like this:

  ```bash
  $ xcodebuild -showBuildSettings | grep DEFAULT_COMPILER
    DEFAULT_COMPILER = com.apple.compilers.llvm.clang.1_0
  ```

* Now the build process:

  ```bash
  cd source/Irrlicht/MacOSX
  xcodebuild -project MacOSX.xcodeproj GCC_VERSION=com.apple.compilers.llvm.clang.1_0
  ```

* And the final step - copy the library to the `lib/MacOSX` directory:

  ```bash
  cp build/Release/libIrrlicht.a ../../../lib/MacOSX
  ```

Phew! That's a damn bunch of commands, don't you think?

### Common

By performing those steps, described above, you will end up with the compiled Irrlicht library file
within the `lib/` directory, depending on your platform:

```txt
Linux/libIrrlicht.a
MacOSX/libIrrlicht.a
Win32-visualstudio/Irrlicht.lib
Win64-visualStudio/Irrlicht.lib
```

Now, create a blank project in your favorite IDE and proceed...

## Application itself

Our first application will show you Irrlicht basic features we will use later. They are:

* **mesh handling** - loading, rendering, animating, etc.
* **user input handling** - reacting to keyboard and mouse events
* **user interface (UI)** - displaying some information within the application window

The good start for that is standard example from Irrlicht pack, the **04 - Movement** one.
Let's take a look over its code:

```cpp
/** Example 004 Movement

This Tutorial shows how to move and animate SceneNodes. The
basic concept of SceneNodeAnimators is shown as well as manual
movement of nodes using the keyboard.  We'll demonstrate framerate
independent movement, which means moving by an amount dependent
on the duration of the last run of the Irrlicht loop.

Example 19.MouseAndJoystick shows how to handle those kinds of input.

As always, I include the header files, use the irr namespace,
and tell the linker to link with the .lib file.

using namespace irr;

/*
To receive events like mouse and keyboard input, or GUI events like "the OK
button has been clicked", we need an object which is derived from the
irr::IEventReceiver object. There is only one method to override:
irr::IEventReceiver::OnEvent(). This method will be called by the engine once
when an event happens. What we really want to know is whether a key is being
held down, and so we will remember the current state of each key.
*/
class MyEventReceiver : public IEventReceiver
{
public:
    // This is the one method that we have to implement
    virtual bool OnEvent(const SEvent& event)
    {
        // Remember whether each key is down or up

        return false;
    }

    }

    bool KeyIsDown[KEY_KEY_CODES_COUNT];
};

/*

will be made inside the render loop, right before drawing the scene. So lets
just create an irr::IrrlichtDevice and the scene node we want to move. We also

different possibilities to move and animate scene nodes.

        would also be able to just call

        animation instead of "setFrameLoop" and "setAnimationSpeed",

## Building the project

Paste the code from above to your blank project in your IDE, in the `source/main.cpp` file.
This may differ, but is not critical. Now, add the `CMakeLists.txt` file to your project
and fill it with these commands:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.1)
project(irrlicht_newton_game1)

set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=c++11")

find_package(X11)
find_package(OpenGL)
find_package(ZLIB)

if (NOT IRRLICHT_LIBRARY_PATH)
    find_library(IRRLICHT_LIBRARY_PATH
            NAMES Irrlicht
            PATHS ${IRRLICHT_PATH}/lib/
            PATH_SUFFIXES Linux MacOSX Win32-gcc Win32-visualstudio Win64-visualstudio)

    message(STATUS "Found Irrlicht: ${IRRLICHT_LIBRARY_PATH}")
endif()

include_directories(${IRRLICHT_PATH}/include)

set(SOURCE_FILES source/main.cpp)
set(EXECUTABLE_NAME irrlicht_newton_game1)

add_executable(${EXECUTABLE_NAME} ${SOURCE_FILES})

target_link_libraries(${EXECUTABLE_NAME}

        ${OPENGL_LIBRARIES}
        ${ZLIB_LIBRARIES}
        ${X11_Xxf86vm_LIB})
```

**Note:** for those of you, guys, running MacOS X I prepared a bit more complicated
`CMakeLists.txt` file - just to make our application run everywhere:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.1)
project(irrlicht_newton_game1)

set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=c++11")

option("NEWTON_DEMOS_SANDBOX" "Build demos sandbox" OFF)

        ${NEWTONGD_PATH}/packages/dContainers
        ${NEWTONGD_PATH}/packages/dMath)

set(NEWTON_LIBRARIES Newton dMath)

add_subdirectory(${LUACPPINTERFACE_PATH})

add_subdirectory(${NEWTONGD_PATH})

find_package(X11)

find_package(Lua)

if (NOT IRRLICHT_LIBRARY_PATH)
    if (UNIX)
        set(IRRLICHT_PATH_SUFFIX Linux)
    endif()

    if (APPLE)
        set(IRRLICHT_PATH_SUFFIX MacOSX)
    endif()

    if (WIN32)
        if (MSVC)
            set(IRRLICHT_PATH_SUFFIX Win32-visualstudio Win64-visualstudio)
        endif()

        if (MINGW)
            set(IRRLICHT_PATH_SUFFIX Win32-gcc)
        endif()
    endif()

    find_library(IRRLICHT_LIBRARY_PATH
            NAMES Irrlicht
            PATHS ${IRRLICHT_PATH}/lib/
            PATH_SUFFIXES ${IRRLICHT_PATH_SUFFIX})

    message(STATUS "Found Irrlicht: ${IRRLICHT_LIBRARY_PATH}")
endif()

set(LIBRARIES luacppinterface
        cppformat
        ${NEWTON_LIBRARIES}
        ${IRRLICHT_LIBRARY_PATH}
        ${X11_LIBRARIES}
        ${OPENGL_LIBRARIES}
        ${ZLIB_LIBRARIES}
        ${LUA_LIBRARIES})

if (NOT APPLE)
    set(LIBRARIES ${LIBRARIES} ${X11_Xxf86vm_LIB})
endif()

include_directories(${IRRLICHT_PATH}/include
        ${LUA_INCLUDE_DIR}
        ${LUACPPINTERFACE_PATH}/include
        ${CPPFORMAT_PATH}
        ${NEWTONGD_INCLUDE_DIRS})

set(SOURCE_FILES source/main.cpp)
set(EXECUTABLE_NAME irrlicht_newton_game1)

add_executable(${EXECUTABLE_NAME} ${SOURCE_FILES})

if (APPLE)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -framework Foundation -framework OpenGL -framework Cocoa -framework Carbon -framework AppKit -framework IOKit")
endif()

target_link_libraries(${EXECUTABLE_NAME}
        ${LIBRARIES})
```

## CMake file

But what happens in all that code? First two lines of our `CMakeLists.txt` file define the project:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.1)
project(irrlicht_newton_game1)
```

Then we modify the variable `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`, which will be used to set compiler flags.
This is how we add items to lists or modify string variables with CMake: we set it the new
value, consisting of the old one and the new elements / parts:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=c++11")
```

Then we tell CMake not to build *Newton demo sandbox* subproject and set a few path variables -
we will use them to point compiler to the header and library files of our third-party libraries
(like Newton itself, Irrlicht and others).

**Remember:** these are only plain variables, they have no effect on compiler themselves.

```cmake
set(LUACPPINTERFACE_PATH source/luacppinterface-master)
set(CPPFORMAT_PATH source/cppformat-master)
set(NEWTONGD_PATH source/newton-dynamics-master)
set(NEWTONGD_INCLUDE_DIRS
        ${NEWTONGD_PATH}/packages/dCustomJoints
        ${NEWTONGD_PATH}/packages/dContainers
        ${NEWTONGD_PATH}/packages/dMath)

set(NEWTON_LIBRARIES Newton dMath)
```

Next, we point CMake to our sub-projects, which are by the fact our third-party libraries:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(${LUACPPINTERFACE_PATH})
add_subdirectory(${CPPFORMAT_PATH})
add_subdirectory(${NEWTONGD_PATH})
```

These tell CMake to build sub-projects before building our application. Because our sub-projects
are nothing but libraries, we can then look for the built libraries, required by our project
in the sub-projects' output directories like this:

```cmake
find_package(Lua)
```

Same way we look for system libraries:

```cmake
find_package(X11)
find_package(OpenGL)
find_package(ZLIB)
```

These commands set compile-ready variables like `X11_LIBRARIES`.

Some sub-projects may set CMake variables too, providing us with paths to include files or
library files. If Irrlicht did not do this, we try to find its paths with CMake:

```cmake
if (NOT IRRLICHT_LIBRARY_PATH)
    if (UNIX)
        set(IRRLICHT_PATH_SUFFIX Linux)
    endif()

    if (APPLE)
        set(IRRLICHT_PATH_SUFFIX MacOSX)
    endif()

    if (WIN32)
        if (MSVC)
            set(IRRLICHT_PATH_SUFFIX Win32-visualstudio Win64-visualstudio)
        endif()

        if (MINGW)
            set(IRRLICHT_PATH_SUFFIX Win32-gcc)
        endif()
    endif()

    find_library(IRRLICHT_LIBRARY_PATH
            NAMES Irrlicht
            PATHS ${IRRLICHT_PATH}/lib/
            PATH_SUFFIXES ${IRRLICHT_PATH_SUFFIX})

    message(STATUS "Found Irrlicht: ${IRRLICHT_LIBRARY_PATH}")
endif()
```

Note the environment variables CMake provides us with: `UNIX`, `APPLE`, `WIN32`, `MSVC`
and many others. They describe which operating system CMake was ran under and which
compiler it was told to use.

And the most important part of our `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```cmake
include_directories(${IRRLICHT_PATH}/include
        ${LUA_INCLUDE_DIR}
        ${LUACPPINTERFACE_PATH}/include
        ${CPPFORMAT_PATH}
        ${NEWTONGD_INCLUDE_DIRS})

set(SOURCE_FILES source/main.cpp)
set(EXECUTABLE_NAME irrlicht_newton_game1)

add_executable(${EXECUTABLE_NAME} ${SOURCE_FILES})
```

This actually runs the **compiler** with the include directories, source files and
output file specified.

After that, we may run **linker** to link the intermediate object files, provided by
compiler, and end up with the application executable:

```cmake
target_link_libraries(${EXECUTABLE_NAME}
        ${LIBRARIES})
```

For OSX users there is a small hack, needed to build the application:

```cmake
if (APPLE)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -framework Foundation -framework OpenGL -framework Cocoa -framework Carbon -framework AppKit -framework IOKit")
endif()
```

**Note the order the commands are specified in:** having include path variables definitions
placed before sub-projects commands may be no harmful, but more *"effective"* commands,
like compiling sub-projects (`add_subdirectory`) depend on other CMake commands, so
be sure to keep the order sane and clean.

## Running the build

Now that you are ready, run the following commands from your project directory
**(you will need `cmake` to be installed in your system)**:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DIRRLICHT_PATH=path_to_directory_where_you_unpacked_irrlicht ..
make
```

**Warning:** do not forget to replace `path_to_directory_where_you_unpacked_irrlicht` with
the actual path to the directory, where your Irrlicht files lay!

This will build our first Irrlicht application. Not obvious how handy it is right now,
but you will see the power of CMake in our later sessions.

Before you run the application, copy the whole `media` directory from the Irrlicht
dir to the parent dir of your project. You should end up with directory structure like this:

```txt
.
└── irrlicht_newton_tutorials
    ├── irrlicht_newton_game1
    │   ├── build
    │   ├── CMakeLists.txt
    │   └── source
    │       └── main.cpp
    └── media
```

**Note:** If you now just run the `irrlicht_newton_game1` binary on OSX, you will see
your application does not react to keyboard events. This is tricky, but you need
to pack your application as OSX application. This is easy, though: just create
a directory tree `mkdir -p irrlicht_newton_game1.app/Contents/MacOS/` and move
your binary file there:

```txt
├── irrlicht_newton_game1.app
│   └── Contents
│       └── MacOS
│           └── irrlicht_newton_game1
```

Open **Finder** and run the application from there. On other operating systems run
the executable file in your `build` directory.

Buuuuut, since we have CMake, we may simplify this task because this is a part of
application build process. So we need to create a usual binary file, when we are
running Linux or Windows or create a directory structure with binary on its deepest
level, when running OSX. CMake allows to do it in a really easy way:

```cmake
if (APPLE)
    add_executable(${EXECUTABLE_NAME} MACOSX_BUNDLE ${SOURCE_FILES})
else()
    add_executable(${EXECUTABLE_NAME} ${SOURCE_FILES})
endif()
```

You should see something like this:

<img data-src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/04_movement_untouched.png">

To end the process you may consider switching to a terminal and running

```bash
pkill irrlicht_newton_game1
```

## Understanding the code

Here are few simple things we could extract from application' code and understand right from scratch:

* Each 3D model is a _scene node_
* Primitive scene nodes (such as _cube_ or _sphere_) could be easily created with built-in functions:

  ```cpp
  scene::ISceneNode* node = smgr->addSphereSceneNode();
  scene::ISceneNode* node = smgr->addCubeSceneNode();
  ```

* Animated 3D models (such as _character models_) could be loaded from file:

  ```cpp
  scene::IAnimatedMeshSceneNode* node = smgr->addAnimatedMeshSceneNode(smgr->getMesh("../../media/ninja.b3d"));
  ```

  **Hint:** if mesh is animated, animation could be started with:

  ```cpp
    node->setFrameLoop(0, 13);
    node->setAnimationSpeed(15);
  ```

  **Hint:** animation could be stopped with setting its speed to zero:

  ```cpp
  node->setAnimationSpeed(0);
  ```

* Node could be described not only by its vertices and indices _(forming a set of triangles which are drawn
in 3D forming a model, called **mesh**)_ but by its **position**, **rotation** and **scale**

  Those could be set with:

  ```cpp
  node->setPosition(core::vector3df(x, y, z));
  node->setRotation(core::vector3df(x_angle, y_angle, z_angle));
  node->setScale(core::vector3df(width_factor, height_factor, depth_factor));
  ```

  **Hint:** rotation is a set of angles relatively to the corresponding axes, the node will be rotated
    around. E. g., `vector3df(45, 90, 0)` sets the rotation by `45 deg` around `X axis`, `90 deg` around `Y axis`
    and no rotation aroung `Z axis`. All those axes are relative to the node itself.

* Graphics User Interface' _(GUI)_ widgets for information output are labels; they are created with
**GUI Manager**:

    ```cpp
    gui::IGUIStaticText* label = device->getGUIEnvironment()->addStaticText(L"", core::rect<s32>(10, 10, 400, 20));
    ```

  **Hint:** its text could be set with:

    ```cpp
    label->setText((const wchar_t*) "some text");
    ```

* User input is handled by an external `IEventReceiver` class object.

  Its method,

    ```cpp
    virtual bool OnEvent(const SEvent& event)
    ```

  defines the logic of handling events like _mouse events_, _keyboard events_, _joystick events_,
    _GUI events_, etc.

  The type of event is passed with the `event.EventType` field. The corresponding field is filled
    with the event parameters.

  For example:

  ```cpp
  if (event.type == EET_MOUSE_INPUT_EVENT) {
      if (event.MouseInput.isLeftPressed()) {
          printf("%d, %d is cursor position\n", event.MouseInput.X, event.mouseInput.Y);
      }
  }
  ```

  **Hint:** `EventReceiver` object has nothing in common with our main game loop. So we should create
    some interface, some architecture trick to link those two. Because they are strongly related!

* Main game loop should contain **rendering call**, **GUI rendering call** and other game logic processing
calls.

  The simplest main loop could look like this:

    ```cpp
    while (device->run()) {
        driver->beginScene(true, true, video::SColor(255, 113, 113, 133));

        smgr->drawAll(); // draw the 3d scene
        device->getGUIEnvironment()->drawAll(); // draw the gui

        driver->endScene();
    }
    ```

* There is no simple _(or at least, built-in)_ way to get the delta time between two rendered frames.
  **This is an important variable!** We'll need that later, when we inject physics engine. And Newton GD
  is not the only engine requiring this variable!

  But that could be easily done with this workaround:

    ```cpp
    // before main loop
    u32 then = device->getTimer()->getTime();

    // ...

    // within the main game loop
    const u32 now = device->getTimer()->getTime();
    const f32 frameDeltaTime = (f32)(now - then) / 1000.f; // delta time in seconds
    then = now;
    ```

That was some short introduction to the Irrlicht engine. And that's basically everything we will use
for the next few sections.
