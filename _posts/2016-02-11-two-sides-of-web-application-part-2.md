## General architecture

The first thing we need to think of is how we'll be gathering the information about users.
It's quite easy - we just need to get a request from a visitor. Of any kind -
it may be a request to get an image, a file, a stylesheet or a script.

Then we'll just parse headers from that request and save the extracted data in the
database. The only problem here is: *how to get unique key from each request?*. We may use
visitor's IP address. It's the easiest way.

Now, letâ€™s decide what pages will our application have and what will they look like:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">
        <a href="/images/two-sides-of-web-application/part1/screen1.webp">
            <img src="/images/two-sides-of-web-application/part1/screen1.webp" loading="lazy" alt="page 1" class="image-responsive">
        </a>
    </div>

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">
        <a href="/images/two-sides-of-web-application/part1/screen2.webp">
            <img src="/images/two-sides-of-web-application/part1/screen2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="page 2" class="image-responsive">
        </a>
    </div>

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">
        <a href="/images/two-sides-of-web-application/part1/screen3.webp">
            <img src="/images/two-sides-of-web-application/part1/screen3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="page 3" class="image-responsive">
        </a>
    </div>

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">
        <a href="/images/two-sides-of-web-application/part1/screen4.webp">
            <img src="/images/two-sides-of-web-application/part1/screen4.webp" loading="lazy" alt="page 4" class="image-responsive">
        </a>
    </div>
</div>

## Templates

Let's create a set of pages, we described above. They will be used later to display real data, but for now
we'll stub the real data with constants.

To make our prototyping smooth and fast, we'll use *Twitter Bootstrap*. We've installed it already with
*Bower*, so we'll be just using it. We need to implement these pages only:

* landing page
* sign up / sign in page
* account settings page
* apps list page
* application page
* application create / edit page

Six pages, huh? Let's do it quick:

*`src/views/layouts/default.jade`:*

```jade

    head
        block head
            title ourStats

            link(rel="stylesheet" href="bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-theme.css")
            script(src="bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js")

    body
        block body

                fieldset.form-group.text-center
                    button.btn.btn-success(type="submit") Create
```

And to make Bower-managed libraries available in our views, we need to add one more path to
the server configuration:

```js
gulp.src(['public/', 'bower_components/'])
    .pipe(server({
        port: 3000,
        livereload: true,
        directoryListing: false,
        open: true
    }));
```

As you can see, we used Jade's block extending and split our templates into one layout and many partials, so
our file tree is clean and changing any of the pages will not be a hard task.

## Architecture details

In our frontend application we'll use something called *MVVM*. That is a design pattern, kindly provided
by Angular. So our *views* will be displaying data and transferring it to controllers *(or ViewModels)*, and
all the logic, handling that data will be defined in *controllers* and *services*, representing *Models*.
Actually, our models will be handled on a server-side, and services will only provide an interface to them.
But that is totally another story and will be described later.

For now let's integrate Angular in our application. And we'll start, deciding how we'll split our
application on the Angular layer. Pages we described above are used for these actions:

<table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Action</th>
            <th>Resource <em>(model)</em></th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>sign in</td>
            <td rowspan="2">Session</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>sign out</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>sign up</td>
            <td rowspan="3">User</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>edit profile</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>update profile</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>add application</td>
            <td rowspan="5">Application</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>edit application</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>update application</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>remove application</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>show application</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>track visitor</td>
            <td>Visitor</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

And so we can define corresponding Angular controllers:

<table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Url</th>
            <th>Controller</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>/</td>
            <td>LandingPage</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>/new-session</td>
            <td>Session</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>/applications</td>
            <td>ListApplications</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>/applications/new</td>
            <td>NewApplication</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>/applications/:id</td>
            <td>ShowApplication</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>/applications/:id/edit</td>
            <td>EditApplication</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>/edit-account</td>
            <td>EditAccount</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Angular

*Angular.js* is a framework by Google for making **SPA**s (*Single-Page Application*).
SPA is a great architecture, where you have a thin backend server, providing an API
to your slim frontend application. And the most interesting part here, is that you have
all your application' pages in a one place, loaded once. And they are switched by a router
in a user's web-browser. So all the communication with server is stripped to data
manipulation requests (*creation, updating and reading data from server*) and first-time
request, sending the HTML, CSS and JavaScripts to user's browser. And then, all the
interactions are performed in a browser. At maximum, frontend application can request
a partial or some assets (*like images*) from a web-server.

Basically, here's how SPA works:

1. user enters a website
2. server sends application' code (implemented in JavaScript) and HTML to user
3. user, say, clicks on a link to change the page
4. if application needs partial, it requests server for a HTML partial
5. application renders a retrieved (or cached) partial in a browser

Let's start and you will see how easy it is!

## Kickstarting

We'll start, adding Angular to our `bower.json` dependencies:

```bash
bower install --save angular
```

Now when we have Angular inside the `bower_components` directory, let's add its references to
our layout:

```jade
head
    script(src="angular/angular.js")
```

Now, the only two things we need to start using Angular right away are:

1. Angular application, defined in the JavaScript and referenced in the `<html>`
tag with `ng-app` **directive**
2. Angular controller, which will contain **scope** with variables and functions for
the page' portion

Yeah, we definitely need some clarifications about those two new words.

## Theory bits

Angular defines a few kind of bricks, you may use to build an entire application:

1. **templates** - dynamically changed HTML files
2. **two-way data binding**, used mostly within **interpolations** - a mechanism
for sharing dynamically changed *(by either user of javascript)* data between
views and code
3. **controllers**, holding **scope** - are JavaScript objects, containing variables and
functions to be used in templates *(functions and variables are put inside a scope, which
is an argument to corresponding controller; I'll describe it later)*
4. **factories** (or **services**) - helper objects, containing logic which is not
*directly* related to views *(displaying and retrieving data)*
5. **directive** - is a place, where HTML-related code is placed

On the other hand, in MVVM architecture we have three layers:

1. **Model** - layer, performing manipulations on data; kind of *database layer*
2. **View** - user interface layer
3. **ViewModel** - stores data to be shown on UI or which was retrieved from UI

Accordingly to this scheme, in Angular we have the next logic structure:

1. **Model** - **Services**
2. **Views** - **Templates**, **Directives**
3. **ViewModel** - **Controllers**

Here I did not mention *two-way data binding* and *scopes*, because first one is a part of *templates* and the second one is a part of *controllers*. And they may not be separated one from another.

## Kickstarting. For real

Let's add some Angular logic into our project. We'll split our app into all those
controllers and services very soon. But first, we need our application in Angular to be
registered. Create a file `config.js` inside the `src/javascripts/` directory
with the following content:

```js
var ourStatsApp = angular.module('ourStatsApp', [  ]);
```

And point the whole layout to use that application with the `ng-app` directive on `<html>` tag:

```js
doctype html
html(lang="en" ng-app="ourStatsApp")
    head
        block head
```

Now when we have our app accessible by all our pages, let's create our first controller,
which will handle exactly one page, the landing page. To expose our controllers,
we need to make a module, consisting of controllers and add it as a dependency
to our application. If you take a look at the application definition, it is also
a module. The first parameter to `angular.module()` function is a module name,
the second one is a list of dependencies.

Controllers are defined in a same way, but the dependency list for them contains
module definition as the last element as well. Let's define a `LandingPageCtrl` controller
in a `src/javascripts/controllers.js` file:

```js
var ourStatsControllers = angular.module('ourStatsControllers', []);

ourStatsControllers.controller('LandingPageCtrl', [ '$scope',
    function ($scope) {
        $scope.apps = 142;
    }
]);
```

Here we defined a module `ourStatsControllers`, which will contain all the controllers
and a `LandingPageCtrl` controller, which is a module of the same name, with a single
dependency - `$scope` and its implementation. As you can see, the `$scope` appears
here twice - first time as a dependency name and second time as an argument
to controller' definition function. That's exactly how **dependency injection** is made
with Angular. Here we defined a scope variable for our controller too, called `apps`.
We'll use it in just a moment.

Note the second argument: it's not required to be a list with dependencies' names first and
controller implementation function, taking all those dependencies as arguments last. This
is done only for the sake of minification. That's it, if you decide to minify your javascript
files, you'll get a lot of errors if you will not specify dependencies' names as first list
items, because most of javascript minifiers shorten your variables' names to just a few
symbols, while keeping strings all the same. So if you are not minifying your javascript files,
this code will work perfectly:

```js
ourStatsControllers.controller('LandingPageCtrl', function ($scope) { ... })
```

Instead, when minified, this controller will be transformed into something like this:

```js
a.controller('LandingPageCtrl',function(b){...})
```

And Angular will try to find a controller, factory or a service, named `b`. And will probably fail.
But if you use *"explicit"* dependency injection, like this:

```js
ourStatsControllers.controller('LandingPageCtrl', [ '$scope', function ($scope) { ... } ])
```

then this code will be minified to something like this:

```js
a.controller('LandingPageCtrl',['$scope',function(b){...}])
```

And then Angular will try to inject the `$scope` service and will succeed.
Just keep this small trick in mind, when developing a real-world Angular applications.

Now we need to inject our controllers module into our application. So we just add a
dependency entry inside our application declaration:

```js
var ourStatsApp = angular.module('ourStatsApp', [ 'ourStatsControllers' ]);
```

As we already defined the `ourStatsControllers` module, we don't need to provide
an implementation for it.

But to make our controller work properly, we need either to declare it on frontend,
making it handle static piece of a page, or make our application use different
controller and view, depending on a route in a browser's address line.

The first approach is good when you use Angular for complex widgets on a page. But
we need something more from our application, so we'll set up router. It'll
parse URL from browser and run the corresponding controller.

Router we'll be using is `ngRoute`. This is a third-party plugin for Angular.
And in order to use it, we need to add a Bower dependency to our project:

```bash
bower install --save-dev angular-route
```

Now we only need to reference it in our app definition:

```js
var ourStatsApp = angular.module('ourStatsApp', [ 'ngRoute', 'ourStatsControllers' ]);
```

The next step is configuring our application routes, making application to
"understand", which controller and which template it should run. This may
be done in the same file, as the application definition:

```js
ourStatsApp.config([ '$routeProvider',
    function ($routeProvider) {
        $routeProvider.
            when('/home', {
                templateUrl: 'partials/landing-page.html',
                controller: 'LandingPageCtrl'
            }).
            otherwise({
                redirectTo: '/home'
            });
    }
]);
```

This configuration makes our application run `LandingPageCtrl` when the `/home` page is
entered. And if the URL entered is not known, application will redirect user to the
`/home` page. All Angular routes are passed as an anchor, so saying *the `/home` page*
we actually mean `http://your.host/#/home`. This makes browser not send requests
to the server, requesting non-existent pages.

Also, note we point our application to use the `partials/home.html` template.
But we did not tell the Angular where to render it. To fix that, we'll
add a `ng-view` directive to the `.container-fluid` element of our `<body>` tag,
right in our layout:

```jade
body
    block body
        .container-fluid(ng-view)
```

Currently, when the project is built with the Gulp' `build` task,
we have a `public/home.html` page, but it is not a partial - it is a standalone
page, extending the layout. But what we need is to compile all our Jade templates
into a `public/partials` directory, making them available through the
`/partials/partial_name.html` URL. And they should not extend the layout, because
then we'll end up with an incorrect HTML code.

To make the magic happen, we only need to change our `build` task for Gulp
to build views directly to the `public` directory. So the `src/views/index.jade`
file will be the main HTML page of our application, available through
`/index.html` URL. And all the partials would be our Angular controllers' templates,
available through `/partials/template_name.html` URLs.

Now the views part of Gulp `build` task should look like this:

```js
gulp.src('src/views/**/*.jade')
    .pipe(jade())
    .pipe(gulp.dest('public/'));
```

And let's just extract the content of `index.jade` partial as it is now, all the
content into a separate Angular partial, `src/views/partials/home.jade`.

And let's add only one small change - add only one line there:

```html
<h1>Currently running {{ apps }} apps</h1>
```

Remember, we have the `$scope` parameter for our `LandingPageCtrl` controller?
And that there we set the `apps` variable? That is it, displaying on our home page.
All the other parameters, added to the `$scope` are available on the corresponding
template, by default. You may display them with some formatting, looping through the list
with `ng-repeat` and using them as conditionals with `ng-if` or `ng-show`.
But let's go step-by-step.

<a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="https://github.com/shybovycha/two-sides-of-web-application/commit/b443618ca13179cc33b7ff2e08d0d6209b323113">Code goes here</a>

## Populating our app with stuff

For now, let's add all the other controllers to our app. Just create empty
controllers according to the table from **part one**, using the same approach as
described right above.

We'll define each controller in its own file, but all of them will be concatenated
into one big application javacript file. We'll use Gulp for this purpose with
its `gulp-concat` plugin.

Let's install it:

```bash
npm install --save gulp-concat
```

Its usage is super-easy: you just redirect the output of our CSS and JS files compiler
to the `concat(filename)` function, providing it with a resulting filename. Like this:

```js
var concat = require('gulp-concat');

gulp.src('src/javascripts/**/*.js')
    .pipe(babel())
    .pipe(concat('all.js'))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('public/javascripts'));

gulp.src('src/stylesheets/**/*.scss')
    .pipe(sass({ style: 'expanded' }))
    .pipe(concat('all.css'))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('public/stylesheets'));
```

Now, the controllers. First we need to set the routes.
The router configuration for our application will look just like this:

```js
$routeProvider
    .when('/', {
        templateUrl: 'landing-page.html',
        controller: 'LandingPageCtrl'
    })
    .when('/new-session', {
        templateUrl: 'new-session.html',
        controller: 'NewSessionCtrl'
    })
    .when('/edit-account', {
        templateUrl: 'edit-account.html',
        controller: 'EditAccountCtrl'
    })
    .when('/applications/:id', {
        templateUrl: 'show-application.html',
        controller: 'ShowApplicationCtrl'
    })
    .when('/applications', {
        templateUrl: 'list-applications.html',
        controller: 'ListApplicationsCtrl'
    })
    .when('/applications/:id/edit', {
        templateUrl: 'edit-application.html',
        controller: 'EditApplicationCtrl'
    })
    .when('/applications/new', {
        templateUrl: 'new-application.html',
        controller: 'NewApplicationCtrl'
    })
    .otherwise({
        redirectTo: '/'
    });
```

And we currently have a lot of pages with broken links. We should fix that,
providing URLs to our *(empty for now)* controllers. Like this one:

```jade
a.btn.btn-primary.btn-lg(href="#/sign-in" role="button") Sign in
```

Fix those links for all the views by yourself - that is not a complex task.
All the routes are described both in the app configuration and in a table
above.
