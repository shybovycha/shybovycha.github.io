This is a chicken. This 3D model I've made in 3.5 hrs in Blender *(with texturing)*.

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="/images/shootthem/chicken_render1-compressed.webp" loading="lazy" alt="" class="img-responsive">
</div>

<div class="vspace"></div>

Taking into account the fact I've started learning *Unity 3D*, I will possibly use this
in the remake of my old <a href="/tumblr/2015/04/06/shootthem.html">Shoot Them!</a> game.
Like this *(early preview, made with Unity 3D in ~3 hrs)*:

<div class="text-center">

</div>
