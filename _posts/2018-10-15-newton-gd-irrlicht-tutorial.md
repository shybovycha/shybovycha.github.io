As there was not a high load on my tutorial on game development with Irrlicht and Newton Game Dynamics engines
as a separate site, I have decided to merge them with my blog and proceed with occasional updates to both as a
whole.

So far, these are the changes to the tutorial in comparison to what it used to be _(long time ago)_:

* moved all the build instructions to **CMake**
* added scripting with **Lua**
* upgraded the whole tutorial to match **latest Irrlicht and Newton versions**
* added chapter on **modelling with Blender**

The things which are already done (just not published yet), in progress and the future plans for this tutorial include:

* comparison of different build systems for C++ (including [CMake](https://cmake.org/), [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) and [Buck](https://buckbuild.com/))
* a better approach to application architecture (plus the comparison of different scripting languages - [AngelScript](https://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/), [Squirrel](http://www.squirrel-lang.org/), [Lua](https://www.lua.org/), [ChaiScript](http://chaiscript.com/) and [Python](https://www.python.org))
* a sane 3D modelling in blender lessons (preserving texturing and adding advanced materials, possibly even animation!)
* advanced topics in Newton Game Dynamics featuring character controller and joints
