I've got amused by how deep and well-designed are those old ASCII-art rogue-like games!
So for the last couple of days I've spent enomerous hours playing as a Necromancer Troll
*(Beat enemies! Eat enemies!)* in ADOM and taking command of a dwarwish horde in Dwarf Fortress.
Amazing level of detail! Most powerfull graphics engine in the world *(which is **your own imagination**)*!
