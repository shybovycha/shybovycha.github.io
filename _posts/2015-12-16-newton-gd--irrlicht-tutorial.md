This post will be really short. This is just a reference to my tutorial, which I
updated recently. It has been a long time since I wrote anything on game development,
that's why it deserves one more announcement.

So, meet the changes:

* moved all the build instructions to **CMake**
* added scripting with **Lua**
* upgraded the whole tutorial to match **latest Irrlicht and Newton versions**
* added chapter on **modelling with Blender**

And more to come!
